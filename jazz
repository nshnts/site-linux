This is for folks who're struggling with jazz, especially jazz improvisation. Here's my story. 
<br>
I picked up saxophone at around the age of 40. Prior to this, I had no musical experience. None. Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be able to play a musical instrument, but never put in the time and effort to make it happen. Why did I pick a sax, of all instruments? I don't know, it must have been that these things are shiny. So, when I finally found myself with a sax in my hands, I got to work. I turned to YouTube, as one does. And as it turns out, if you go about looking for sax tutorials on the internet, you're going to run into jazz music. Saxophone plays a central role in most jazz bands - this singular fact was about to change the rest of my life.

Very early on in my sax journey, I got hooked to Miles Davis. Charlie Parker, Stan Getz, Dexter Gordon, etc. are great, but Miles is something else. It speaks to me. It's cool, and I like cool. At this point, it had been about a year, and I could play the major scale in C and maybe G. I had been working through some method book, and these tunes were boring as hell. It sounded nothing like jazz, and practice sessions were torture. YouTube can be helpful, but it's hard to keep moving in one direction when you're looking at 20 videos in parallel. I concluded that I was getting nowhere, and that I'll get help - find a teacher.
